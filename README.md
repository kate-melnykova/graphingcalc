Function factorial.py computes factorial by 
Fikret Cihana, Fatih Aydinb, Adnan Fatih Kocamaz
(https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7388/ef8a3fa31b2d01f2835b3beeccdb16c0616a.pdf)
(no parallel computing part) This method is
significantly faster than recursive implementation.

Function compute_pi.py uses Chudnovsky algorithm
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm)
for computing the value of pi.

Function compute_e.py utilizes Brothers' Formulae
